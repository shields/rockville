# rockville

A small, local-first bridge that exposes a Roborock vacuum on your own MQTT
broker — state, telemetry, and control — so it can be driven from Home Assistant
or any MQTT client. It is built for the Roborock Q5 Max+ and other V1-protocol
Roborock vacuums.

rockville is modeled on [hoboken](https://github.com/shields/hoboken) and
follows the conventions in
[right-answers](https://github.com/shields/right-answers).

## How it connects

rockville talks to the vacuum through the
[`python-roborock`](https://github.com/Python-roborock/python-roborock) library.
A one-time cloud login fetches the device list, each device's local key, and its
LAN address; everything is cached on disk as JSON. After that, routine status
polling and commands run **over the LAN**, so there are no cloud rate limits and
the bridge keeps working when Roborock's cloud is down.

This is local-_preferred_, not strictly cloud-free: `python-roborock` still
opens a best-effort connection to Roborock's own cloud MQTT for push updates.
rockville does not depend on it — control and status use the local connection —
but it is opened opportunistically. The vacuum's LAN address is discovered
through one cloud call and then cached (refreshed roughly every 12 hours), so a
DHCP reservation, or the optional static `ip` in the config, keeps the bridge
from needing the cloud to find the vacuum.

## Requirements

- Python 3.14, managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
- A Roborock cloud account and a V1-protocol vacuum (e.g. the Q5 Max+).
- Your own MQTT broker (e.g. Mosquitto).

## Quick start

```sh
uv sync
```

### Authenticate

The bridge authenticates unattended with your account password. Set it in the
environment and rockville logs in on startup:

```sh
export ROBOROCK_PASSWORD='your-password'
```

If password login is unavailable for your account, use the interactive
email-code fallback once to cache credentials:

```sh
uv run rockville login
```

### Configure

Copy `config.example.yaml` to `config.yaml` and edit it. The DUID of each vacuum
can be found in the Roborock app or via the `python-roborock` CLI. A static `ip`
(with a DHCP reservation) lets rockville skip the cloud address lookup.

### Run

```sh
CONFIG_PATH=config.yaml PERSIST_PATH=./persist uv run rockville run
```

### Logging

Logs go to stderr. Set `LOG_FORMAT=json` for machine-readable output (anything
else renders a human-friendly console format). `LOG_LEVEL` sets the threshold
and must be an **uppercase** standard level name — `DEBUG`, `INFO` (the
default), `WARNING`, `ERROR`, or `CRITICAL`.

## MQTT topics

All topics are published under `{topic_prefix}/{device}` (the prefix defaults to
`rockville` and `device` is the configured name). State topics are **retained**;
command topics are not.

### State (published)

| Topic                          | Example payload                     | Notes                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `…/availability`               | `online` / `offline`                | Per-device reachability.                               |
| `…/state`                      | `cleaning`                          | The vacuum's state name (e.g. `idle`, `charging`).     |
| `…/battery`                    | `80`                                | Battery percentage.                                    |
| `…/fan_speed`                  | `balanced`                          | Current fan-speed name.                                |
| `…/error`                      | `{"code":0,"name":"none"}`          | Decoded error code.                                    |
| `…/cleaning/area_m2`           | `12.3`                              | Area cleaned this run, in m².                          |
| `…/cleaning/time_s`            | `845`                               | Time cleaned this run, in seconds.                     |
| `…/dock`                       | `charging`                          | Synthesized dock state.                                |
| `…/connection`                 | `local` / `cloud` / `offline`       | How the vacuum is currently reachable.                 |
| `…/consumable/main_brush`      | `{"hours_left":248.0,"percent":83}` | Remaining life. Also `side_brush`, `filter`, `sensor`. |
| `{prefix}/bridge/availability` | `online` / `offline`                | Bridge liveness (the MQTT Last-Will topic).            |

### Commands (subscribed)

| Topic             | Payload                                  | Action              |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `…/command/set`   | `start` `stop` `pause` `return` `locate` | Control the vacuum. |
| `…/fan_speed/set` | a fan-speed name (e.g. `balanced`)       | Set the fan speed.  |

Try it with the Mosquitto clients:

```sh
mosquitto_sub -t 'rockville/#' -v
mosquitto_pub -t 'rockville/downstairs/command/set' -m start
```

## Metrics and status page

When `metrics` is configured, rockville serves on that port:

- `/metrics` — Prometheus metrics (`rockville_*`).
- `/` — a live status page that updates over Server-Sent Events.
- `/healthz` and `/readyz` — health and readiness checks.

## Deployment

### Docker

```sh
docker build -t rockville .
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD/config.yaml:/config/config.yaml:ro" \
  -v rockville-persist:/persist \
  -e ROBOROCK_PASSWORD -e MQTT_PASSWORD \
  rockville
```

The image is distroless and runs as a non-root user.

### Kubernetes

`k8s/deployment.yaml` is a starting point. It uses `hostNetwork` so the pod can
reach the vacuum on the LAN, a `PersistentVolumeClaim` for the cached
credentials and device cache, and a `Secret` for the Roborock and MQTT
passwords. Create the config and secret first:

```sh
kubectl create configmap rockville-config --from-file=config.yaml
kubectl create secret generic rockville-secrets \
  --from-literal=roborock-password=… --from-literal=mqtt-password=…
```

## Development

```sh
make lint   # ruff format check, ruff, ty (src), prettier
make test   # pytest with 100% coverage enforced
make run    # run the bridge locally
make image  # build the container image
```

The bridge core is tested without the network or a real broker: all
`python-roborock` access is behind an injected backend, and the MQTT client is
faked. The test suite holds 100% line and branch coverage.
